Blocks 
When choosing names avoid picking ones from the C++ library
Curly braces should open at the beginning of a block of code and closing it at the end of the block
Lines shouldnt be too long so that the user does not have to scroll to see where the line ends
or writing less than 80 characters
If a line is too long try to reduce indentation or rewrite your code
Expressions should be easy to read and if complex and long put in parentheses where the user
can easily read it
